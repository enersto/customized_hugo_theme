## What does this site contain

This site is hosted by Pauke Huang, and the site title “IFF”  is the abbreviation of “Initiative, Freiheit, Fortschritt | Initiative, Liberty, Progress”(yep, I got inspired from[***Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libert%C3%A9,_%C3%A9galit%C3%A9,_fraternit%C3%A9), which is my motto and what I wanna express in this blog’s articles. You might get the thought this is a more political related site. And it’s half right, I might post some culture and political words in the future. But my now job(data analyst) and my interest on computer science, you can also read software and tool posts(most of them is data analysis related).
